## 💾 Install

### HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=gaco79&repository=gcclock-words&category=plugin)

### Manual install (Not recommended)

1. Download and copy `gcclock-words.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/gaco79/gcclock-words/releases/latest) into your `config/www` directory.
2. Add the resource reference inside your `configuration.yaml`

```yaml
lovelace:
  mode: yaml
  resources:
    - url: /local/gcclock-words.js
      type: module
```

## 📐 Configuration

In Home Assistant click `Edit Dashboard`, then `Add Card` and scroll down to find "Custom: Time In Words". All options except language can be configured by the graphical editor. `language:` can be used as a key in the YAML editor and specifying `en-GB`, `nl`, or `de`. This is not currently configurable via the graphical editor.

#### Sample Configuration

```YAML
type: custom:gcclock-words
highlight_text_color: "#dd4b4b"
show_highlight_glow: false
muted_text_brightness: 0.07
```

## Alternatives

I've also got an analogue clock Home Assistant card available [here](https://github.com/gaco79/clock-simple)

## Development

To develop the card:

- Clone this repository
- Run `docker compose up -d` from the cloned directory
- Run `npm start`
- Browse to `http://localhost:8123/` and configure your home assistant development build
- Add the card to a dashboard as described above

### Inspiration

This repository is inspired by [chrisdothtml's codepen](https://codepen.io/chrisdothtml/pen/BQbzoQ) and was initially based on code and development environment from [uptime-card](https://github.com/dylandoamaral/uptime-card).
