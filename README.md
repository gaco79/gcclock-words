## üíæ Install

:warning: This card is under active development, is not very stable, and may still have many bugs. Please create an issue if you encounter a bug or have a feature request.

### HACS (recommended)

This card is available in [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) (Home Assistant Community Store).

### Manual install

Not recommended.

1. Download and copy `gcclock-words.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/gaco79/gcclock-words/releases/latest) into your `config/www` directory.

## üìê Configuration
