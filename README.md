### HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=gaco79&repository=gcclock-words&category=plugin)

I've submitted a PR to be included in the HACS default repository.

2. Add the resource reference inside your `configuration.yaml` with URL `/local/gcclock-words.js` and type `module`.
3. Add the custom card to your panel and üöÄ.

## üìê Configuration

In Home Assistant click `Edit Dashboard`, then `Add Card` and scroll down to find "Custom: Time In Words". 

### Inspiration

This repository is inspired by [chrisdothtml's codepen](https://codepen.io/chrisdothtml/pen/BQbzoQ) and was initially based on code and development environment from [uptime-card](https://github.com/dylandoamaral/uptime-card).
